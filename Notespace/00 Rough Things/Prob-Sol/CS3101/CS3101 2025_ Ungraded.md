**Instructions:** Please write each program from scratch on your own. No copying and pasting from slides or use of tools like ChatGPT should be deployed. You must carefully look into the class materials before attempting and ask for help from your designated TA if you fail after a sincere effort. 

You are discouraged from talking loudly in the lab, as others may feel disturbed. You may discuss with your neighboring batchmate, but in a soft tone. You are also discouraged from using the lab computers for other activities except solving the assignment during the lab session.

**Set 1**

1. Write a program in C programming language to print your name on the terminal.  
     
2. Write a program in C	programming language to take a number as input from the user and print its square on the terminal.

3. Write a program in C	programming language to take as input two numbers and swap them using a third variable.

4. Write a program in C	programming language to take as input two numbers and swap them without using a third variable.

5. Write a program in C	programming language to take as input the base (b) and height (h) of a triangle and print the area on the terminal (formula: area \= (½)\*base\*height).

6. Write a program in C	programming language to take the principal amount (P), time in years (T), and rate of interest (R) as input and print the Simple Interest (SI) and the Total Amount (A) on the terminal (formula: SI \= (P\*T\*R)/100, A \= P \+ SI).

7. Write a program in C	programming language to take as input the radius (R) and height (H) of a cone and print the volume on the terminal (formula: volume \= PI\*r\*r\*(h/3)).

8. Write a C program to take the name (e.g., Kripa) and age (41) (supposing your name is “Sachin” and your age is 50) as input from the user and print a message on the terminal: “Hello Kripa, you are 41 years old. I am Sachin, I am 50 years old”.  
   

      9\. Correct the following C programs and run the corrected versions:

i) 

//Desired output: Hello world\!\\n

*int main()*  
*{*  
	*print(“Hello world\!\\n”)*  
*}*

ii)  
//Make sure the program runs. The value of k is not important.

*\#include\<stdio.h\>*

*int  main()*  
*{*  
	*int i \= 5, j \= 6, k;*

	*k \= (i \+ j)/(j \- 6);*

	*printf("k \= %d\\n", k);*

*}*

iii) 

//Desired output: Miss mona please transfer Rs. 25000 to my account.

*\#include\<stdio.h\>*

*int  main()*  
*{*  
	*int amount \= 25,000;*  
	*char name\[\] \= 'mona';*  
	  
	*printf("Miss %s please transfer Rs. %d to my account.\\n", name, amount);*

*}*
