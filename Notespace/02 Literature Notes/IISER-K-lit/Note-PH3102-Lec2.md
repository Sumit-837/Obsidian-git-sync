## Linear Operators
Main rules:
- They follow linear superposition:  $\hat{L}(f(x)+g(x))=\hat{L}f(x)+\hat{L}g(x)$
- Don't act on scalars: $\hat{L}(cf(x))=c\hat{L}f(x)$
__Example:__ Differential operator $D$ is a linear operator. and it's eigenfunction is $e^x$.
## Hermitian Operators
- These linear operators when acting on their eigenfunctions, give ==Real== eigenvalues.
- Expectation value of $\hat{L}$ and $\hat{L}^\dagger$ are same. [[Book-PH3102-QM-S.Lal.pdf#page=48|page-48 (4.4)]]
