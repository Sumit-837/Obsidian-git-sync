- Hamiltonian operator $\hat{H}$ shows the time evolution of the state. 
$$
\hat{H} = \iota\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}
$$
- We must try to find the eigenstates of Hamiltonian. then we can find out the energy eigenvalues.
- All observables are associated to linear operators.
- If I want to measure any observable of a state, I need to sandwich the observable's operator between the $\psi^*$ and $\psi$ and integrate it. we get __expectation value__.
- When a linear operator act on one of **its eigenstates** , only then we'll get out a number (eigenvalue) multiplied with the state.
